\section*{Approach}
Because we are not skilled cryptographers and others are already analyzing these algorithms \cite{Sha3Zoo}, we will instead explore the implementation feasibility and runtime speed of a subset of the round 2 SHA-3 candidates.
We plan to evaluate the implementation feasibility and computational efficiency of the following SHA-3 candidates: Skein, CubeHash and Echo.
We chose Skein and CubeHash primarily based on the popularity of the authors in the cryptographic community, and we chose Echo because it is based upon AES.
While each of these algorithms already have general purpose implementations, we plan to implement them for execution on a GPU using the OpenCL framework.

There is currently a wealth of information for FPGA and ASIC implementations of these algorithms, however we are unaware of OpenCL implementations of any of the SHA-3 candidates \cite{Sha3Hardware}.
Our hypothesis is that some of these algorithms might benefit from parallel execution while others may not.
Thus, we will compare out runtime results on the GPU with runtime results on a CPU.
