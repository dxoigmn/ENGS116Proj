\section*{Conclusions}

We can conclude from this study that if only speed is taken into account, no matter your hardware configuration you should choose the Skein algorithm.
About OpenCL we can conclude that it is not yet ready for production use.
Even across two video cards specifically supported by Apple's implementation of OpenCL these hash functions performed in drastically different ways.
Additionally, a kernel run on a CPU can often perform in drastically different ways than the same kernel run on a GPU.
