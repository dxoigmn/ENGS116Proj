\begin{abstract}
In November of 2007, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the request for submission of candidate algorithms for the Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3).
Because of recent attacks against the current standards, NIST ``decided that it is prudent to develop a new hash algorithm to augment and revise FIPS 180â€“2'' \cite{Sha3Request}.

As the second round of candidates were recently chosen in September, we decided to choose a few of them--CubeHash \cite{CubeHash}, Skein \cite{Skein}, and ECHO \cite{ECHO}--and see if it is feasible to implement them in a GPU computing architecture.
In particular, we chose to implement them in Open Computing Language (OpenCL), which provides a framework for executing ``kernels'' on a variety of devices (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, etc.).

We found that while all the hash algorithms performed more poorly on the NVIDIA GPU than the CPU, the ECHO hash algorithm actually performed faster on the ATI GPU than it did on either the NVIDIA GPU or the CPU.
The ECHO algorithm on the ATI GPU even performed faster than the CubeHash algorithm on the CPU.
